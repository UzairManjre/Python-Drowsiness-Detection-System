# Python-Drowsiness-Detection-System
This project implements a drowsiness detection system using a pre-trained machine learning model. The system is built using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. It detects the state of the eyes in real-time from a webcam feed and alerts the user when signs of drowsiness are detected.
